Our experiments show that there are some differences between the results. These differences do not verify some claims from the paper \cite{paper} we reviewed. We should note that we were not able do run all experiments, more specific we did not experiment bucket elimination and the special types of graphs. We think that the differences can be explained by the PostgreSQL optimizer, which is capable of optimizing the more simple and naive queries and cannot optimize the complex queries. Another reason why our results differ has to do with the computation of the Cartesian product. Using JOIN operations to compute this is a lot slower than with the FROM and WHERE clauses. Overall we are able to verify that all approaches are exponential in running time.
