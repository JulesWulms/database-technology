\section{Discussion of progress}
Currently, the graph generator is mostly finished. We can generate graphs having scaling graph order or density, while maintaining constant values for the variables we do not want to vary. What remains to be done, is extending the graph generator with an option to generate graphs that have a specific structure, like the augmented and ladder graphs. \\

The graph translator has been set up in such a way that we can start programming on the different algorithms in parallel. This is important, since it is the biggest part of the implementation of the process.
